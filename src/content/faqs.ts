        a: "Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a compact way to write IP address ranges and their network masks."
    },
    {
        q: "Why is CIDR notation useful?",
        a: "It lets network engineers allocate address space precisely, aggregate routes and keep routing tables smaller."
    },

        q: "How is an IP address structured?",
        a: "An IPv4 address consists of four 8-bit numbers (octets) ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots."
    },
    {
        q: "What does the number after the slash mean?",
        a: "The slash value (e.g. /24) shows how many bits belong to the network prefix; the rest identify individual hosts."

    {
        q: "How does this calculator help?",
        a: "Paste any IP/CIDR and it instantly shows netmask, broadcast address, usable host range and a visual bit map."
